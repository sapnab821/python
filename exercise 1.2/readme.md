For each individual recipe I chose to use a dictionary. This is because the dictionary has key, value pairs and this is useful 
because there is a need for three key value pairs- for name, time and ingredients. Thus it would make the most sense to use 
dictionary for this purpose

For all the recipes I chose the list. I chose list instead of tuple because lists are more easily changed and the list of recipes
will be constantly changed.
